## Exponential model

The exponential model fits the behaviour by calculating an action value based on the outcomes of the previous 8 trials, that will lead to a preadiction of the probability of stay.   


**Action Value** = $\sum\limits_{i=0}^8 a*e^{-b * t}+c$

**Probability of stay** = $\sigma [\sum\limits_{i=0}^8 a*e^{-b * t}+c ]$
